4. In the Automatic Replies box, select **Send automatic replies**.
   - Optionally, set a date range for your automatice replies. This will turn off automatic replies at the date and time you enter for the end tiem. Otherwise, you'll need to turn off automic replies manually upon return to office.
5. On the **"Inside My Organization"** tab, type the response that you want to send to notify users while you are out of the office.

6. If you want to send out of office notifications to users _outside_ of the organization. Set up the **"Outside My Organization"** tab.
   - **Note:** This is automically set to OFF and is not always necessary or desireable. Sending automatic replies to anyone outside my organization will send your automatic reply to _every_ email, including newsletters, advertisements, and potentially, junk email. If you want to send automatic replies to those outside your organization, we recommend choosing **My contacts only**.
7. 6. **IMPORTANT:** If you don't see the above option, you will have to use _rules_ to send an out of office message (see below).

## Using Rules to Send Automatic Replies

Only certain types of accounts support the Automatic Replies (Out-of-Office) feature. If you don't see the Automatic Replies button, _your email account doesn't support this feature_. However, if you leave Outlook running while you're away, you can use rules to reply to your email messages automatically. Rules also allow you to forward emails to another account, mark messages as read, or move them to a folder automatically.
