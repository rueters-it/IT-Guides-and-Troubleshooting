# Porting The Hill Landline to Mobile 

As of August 2025, the Hill phone system consists of a landline (515-738-2633) and a mobile phone (515-732-1282). An attempt was made by popular demand that a mobile phone is best for the business. A Verizon number was established as a result of the Hill landline consistently going out. The landline is through Kinetic. 

The Verizon number will be cancelled and a porting process from Kinetic to a different/same mobile carrier should be established using The Hill business credentials (contrast with employee personal information) for overall better functionality and management of the mobile device in the future. 

The best way to establish this is to port the Kinetic land line number to US Celluar in Jefferson. US Cellular is the prominent mobile carrier that is closest to The Hill. Porting will ensure the same number is used for the Hill. Establishing a new mobile number will requiring changing the Google Profile number for The Hill Golf course. For this, you will have to "recover" the business profile if you don't own or manage it already on Google.

## Port Kinet to U.S. Ceulluar (or Verizon) 
To port a Kinetic (formerly Windstream) phone number to U.S. Cellular, you'll need to provide your new carrier with specific information from your Kinetic account and initiate the porting process with them. The following info will likely be needed so it is good to gather these info and have them on hand: 
- Current phone number (5151-738-2633)
- The ZIP code of The Hill (50107)
- The account number associated with your Kinetic service
- Potentially a porting PIN or passcode (created and documented when phone line was established)
- Possibly Federal Tax ID Number or Employer Identification Number (EIN) for The Hill to set up business account
- Ensure Kinetic account is in good standing

### Steps to Port Kinetic Number
1. Contact U.S. Cellular (or mobile carier) to start the process (call or visit the store)
2. A business account will be created
3. Provide the information above to US Cellular rep
4. Understand that porting could take up to a week
5. Contact Kintetic if needed for additional info or assistance
